# GUIDE TO OPTIMAL MCP SERVER DESIGN

## 1. Why This Guide Exists

Model Context Protocol (MCP) adoption has exploded across cloud, enterprise, and independent agent stacks. This growth surfaced recurring pain points: tool-space interference, large response footpr[...]

## 2. Core Design Principles

| Principle | What it means | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Precision over breadth** | Serve atomic, clearly-scoped tools, but expose them contextually. | Larger tool menus degrade success rates by up to 85 %. |
| **Declarative metadata** | Publish machine-readable capability tags, expected I/O sizes, and complexity hints. | Enables client-side routing and macro fallbacks with minimal manual configuration.[...]
| **Workflow-first ergonomics** | Provide macros that orchestrate multi-step flows alongside atomic tools. | Smaller models benefit from deterministic workflows, mirroring MemTool’s “workflow mode[...]
| **Defense in depth** | Harden tool selection, metadata, and execution paths against manipulation and impersonation attacks. | Preference-manipulation and mixed attack suites already exist in the wil[...]  
| **Observability and feedback loops** | Ship metrics on tool calls, latency, and error ratios; surface them via resources. | Real usage data guides macro design and tool pruning. |

## 3. Tool Portfolio Strategy

1. **Segment by workflow cluster.** Organize tools by the dominant tasks they support (e.g., Infrastructure, Messaging, File Reservations). This mirrors how agents build mental models and keeps co[...]  
2. **Annotate capabilities + complexity.** Add metadata such as "capabilities": ["messaging", "write"] and "complexity": "high". Clients can hide high-complexity tools when routing small model[...]  
3. **Expose curated macro tools.** Provide workflow macros (e.g., `macro_start_session`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`) that encapsulate multi-step flows but still return the underlying atomic re[...]  
4. **Document I/O characteristics.** Include average response size and latency in tool documentation or a `resource://tooling/characteristics` feed to stop agents from binding to a tool that would[...]  

**Checklist**  
☑ No cluster exposes more than ~7 atomic tools simultaneously.  
☑ Every tool schema includes `description`, `capabilities`, `complexity`, `expected_tokens`.  
☑ Macros exist for the top three multi-step workflows and return audit-friendly payloads.

## 4. Adaptive Tool Exposure & Memory

**Server-side supports:**

- **Capability gating:** Add a lightweight guard that checks for capability tokens on the MCP context (e.g., `allowed_capabilities=["file_reservations"]`). Agents can request only the permissions [...]  
- **Recent usage resource:** Surface `resource://tooling/recent?agent=X&project=Y` to help clients replay successful tool sequences.  
- **Macro recommendations:** Return `next_actions` hints in macro responses (e.g., "Consider `file_reservation_paths` renew in 30 minutes") to combine deterministic workflows with agent autonomy.

**Client integration guidance:** Encourage clients to pull `resource://tooling/directory` and `resource://tooling/metrics` at connect time, then mount only the relevant cluster—a pattern that al[...]

## 5. Schema & Payload Hygiene

| Anti-pattern | Fix | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deeply nested JSON parameters | Flatten structure, use enums for mode switching | Performance drops as schema depth increases; some servers hit 20 levels. |
| Ambiguous names (“search”, “run”) | Prefix with domain (`file_reservations_search`, `repo_run_hook`) | Reduces namespace collisions noted across hundreds of servers.[...]
| Unlimited list params | Enforce bounds (e.g., `maxItems: 20`) | Prevents response explosions and denial-of-context attacks. |
| Unbounded output (full PDFs) | Paginate via resource handles | Large outputs are a primary driver of tool-space interference. |

---

## 6. Observability & Feedback Loops

1. **Emit structured metrics.** Log `tool_metrics_snapshot` events with `calls`, `errors`, `latency_ms`, and `cluster`.  
2. **Expose metrics resource.** Provide `resource://tooling/metrics` to allow dashboards without log ingestion.  
3. **Alerting thresholds.** Trigger alerts when `errors/calls` > 5 % for five consecutive intervals or latency > SLO.  
4. **Surface to clients.** Encourage clients to read metrics before exposing tools to end-users, closing the loop between server quality and UI choices.

Sample pipeline and Loki/Prometheus configs are included in `docs/observability.md`.

## 7. Security Hardening

| Threat | Mitigation | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Preference manipulation via metadata | Normalize descriptions, reject marketing superlatives, rotate tool IDs | |
| Name-collision hijacks | Namespace every tool (`<server>::<tool>`) and refuse collisions | |
| Prompt injection in responses | Enforce strict output schemas, strip tool-to-tool instructions, provide “safe mode” flag | |
| Mixed attack suites (MSB) | Run MSB regression tests pre-release; track Net Resilient Performance | |
| Cross-provider trust issues | Advertise signing keys, provide checksum of server build, expose provenance resource | |

Security regression testing cadence: run MSB weekly, record NRP deltas, gate releases on non-negative change.

## 8. Client & Ecosystem Alignment

- **Promote standards-based coordination.** Microsoft and other vendors are pushing for interoperable agents; MCP servers should publish compatibility matrices (tested clients, models, schema vers[...]  
- **Provide starter kits.** Offer sample clients (Python/TypeScript) that demonstrate directory fetching, cluster mounting, macros, and metrics polling. See `examples/client_bootstrap.py`.  
- **Encourage mixed-client testing.** Validate against at least one deterministic orchestrator (Workflow Mode) and one autonomous orchestrator (Autonomous Mode) per MemTool categorization to ensur[...]

## 9. Release & QA Checklist

| Stage | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Design** | Cluster inventory ≤ 7 tools; macros defined; metadata complete. |
| **Implementation** | Capability gates enforced; schema validation with JSON Schema or Pydantic; response pagination implemented. |
| **Security** | MSB and MPMA regression tests pass; namespace collisions blocked; signing keys rotated quarterly. |
| **Performance** | Tool metrics show error ratio < 2 % over 1 k calls; latency SLO met (target < 1 s per tool). |
| **Observability** | `tool_metrics_snapshot` emitted; dashboards/alerts configured; `resource://tooling/metrics` returning data. |
| **Docs** | README includes quickstart; compatibility matrix; link to observability and client starter guides. |
