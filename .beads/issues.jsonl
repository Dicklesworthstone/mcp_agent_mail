Check if other file handles accumulate (locks, config files, etc.)\n2. Consider increasing LRU cache size or more aggressive cleanup\n3. Add file handle monitoring/metrics\n\n**Current Mitigation:**\n- clear_repo_cache() called on error (app.py:324)\n- Recovery works but user must retry operation\n\nReference: https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/mcp_agent_mail/issues/59","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-05T21:17:09.114719-05:00","created_by":"jemanuel","updated_at":"2026-01-05T21:17:09.114719-05:00"}
