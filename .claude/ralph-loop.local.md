You are creating a comprehensive TDD-driven PRD for applying the KellerAI design system to the Agent Mail interface. 

Use the Sentinel Research style system as the reference: 
- Colors: Dark theme with cyan/emerald/amber/rose/violet accents
- Typography: Instrument Serif display, DM Sans body, JetBrains Mono code
- Components: Cards, buttons, badges, code blocks with KellerAI styling
- Layout: Responsive grid system, fixed navigation, content sections

Your task: Create a detailed PRD that specifies:
1. Design tokens CSS variables (colors, fonts, spacing, shadows, glows)
2. Component styling (buttons, cards, badges, inputs, tables)
3. Layout templates (inbox view, thread view, settings)
4. Dark mode implementation
5. Accessibility requirements (contrast, touch targets, focus states)
6. Responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)

Produce test specifications for each component that define acceptance criteria before implementation.

Generate the PRD in 3 rounds of iterative refinement:
- Round 1: Core structure and design tokens
- Round 2: Component specifications with test cases
- Round 3: Layout templates and responsive design
