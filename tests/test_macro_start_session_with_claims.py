    Test macro_start_session WITH file_reservation_paths parameter.

    This test specifically exercises the code path that was broken by the
    globals().get("file_reservation_paths") bug (now fixed to use mcp.get_tool("file_reservation_paths")).

    The bug was: macro_start_session has a parameter named 'file_reservation_paths' which
    shadowed the file_reservation_paths function. Using mcp.get_tool("file_reservation_paths") avoids global lookups.

    The fix: Use mcp.get_tool("file_reservation_paths") to get the tool from the registry.
